Iglu is an atomic framework, written in Java. It's a reference implementation for research focused
on the configuration of an application in terms of components, clusters, facades and their relations.
It helps developers organize high-level separation of concerns and adhere to application design.

Iglu Http contains utilities and components that allow developers to build
a runtime servlet environment.

Iglu is developed and maintained by Jeroen Meetsma, partner at IJsberg.
